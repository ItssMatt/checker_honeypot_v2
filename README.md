# Honeypot checker v2

My second version of a honeypot checker. It scans the whole source code line by line, stores every function and checks if it is tampered in any way, especially the
transfer functions.
This is what I used in 2021 before I purchased any cryptocurrency that was on the BSC Blockchain.
It also contains a basic hardware license check in the SQL Database.
